question 1: for the first part, we were tasked with drawing a catcher sprite for a game in which you have to control the catcher to "catch" falling objects. for my sprite, I made a baseball glove out of two brown ellipses, one for the main part of the glove and one for the thumb part.

question 2: for the second part, we were tasked with making our sprite move and animate when the mouse is pressed. for my baseball glove, I made the thumb ellipse close and the main ellipse shrink to make the glove appear to grab and close when the user clicks the mouse.

question 3: for the third part, we were tasked with making a sprite fall from a random point on the canvas. for my sprite, I made a baseball fall from a random point along the top of the canvas every time the mouse is clicked. each new time the mouse is clicked, the ball also has a random speed between the set values.
