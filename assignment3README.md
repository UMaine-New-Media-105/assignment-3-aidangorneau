question 1: for the first part, we were tasked with drawing a catcher sprite for a game in which you have to control the catcher to "catch" falling objects. for my sprite, I made a baseball glove out of two brown ellipses, one for the main part of the glove and one for the thumb part.

question 2: for the second part, we were tasked with making our sprite move and animate when the mouse is pressed. for my baseball glove, I made the thumb ellipse close and the main ellipse shrink to make the glove appear to grab and close when the user clicks the mouse.

question 3: for the third part, we were tasked with making a sprite fall from a random point on the canvas. for my sprite, I made a baseball fall from a random point along the top of the canvas every time the mouse is clicked. each new time the mouse is clicked, the ball also has a random speed between the set values.

question 4: for the forth part, we were tasked with making a sprite fall from the top of the canvas when the mouse was pressed. for my baseball, I made it fall from a random point along the top of the canvas when the mouse is clicked. I also added a boolean variable in order to check if the baseball was currently falling (ballFalling) or had touched the ground (groundY), in order to make the baseball reset and allow for it to fall again after touching the ground.
