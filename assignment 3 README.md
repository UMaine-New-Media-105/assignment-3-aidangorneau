question 1: for the first part, we were tasked with drawing a catcher sprite for a game in which you have to control the catcher to "catch" falling objects. for my sprite, I made a baseball glove out of two brown ellipses, one for the main part of the glove and one for the thumb part. 

question 2: for the second part, we were tasked with making our sprite move and animate when the mouse is pressed. for my baseball glove, I made the thumb ellipse close and the main ellipse shrink to make the glove appear to grab and close when the user clicks the mouse.
