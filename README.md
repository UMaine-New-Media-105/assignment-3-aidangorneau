question 1: for the first part, we were tasked with drawing a catcher sprite for a game in which you have to control the catcher to "catch" falling objects. for my sprite, I made a baseball glove out of two brown ellipses, one for the main part of the glove and one for the thumb part.

question 2: for the second part, we were tasked with making our sprite move and animate when the mouse is pressed. for my baseball glove, I made the thumb ellipse close and the main ellipse shrink to make the glove appear to grab and close when the user clicks the mouse.

question 3: for the third part, we were tasked with making a sprite fall from a random point on the canvas. for my sprite, I made a baseball fall from a random point along the top of the canvas every time the mouse is clicked. each new time the mouse is clicked, the ball also has a random speed between the set values.

question 4: for the forth part, we were tasked with making a sprite fall from the top of the canvas when the mouse was pressed. for my baseball, I made it fall from a random point along the top of the canvas when the mouse is clicked. I also added a boolean variable in order to check if the baseball was currently falling (ballFalling) or had touched the ground (groundY), in order to make the baseball reset and allow for it to fall again after touching the ground.

question 5: for the fifth part, we were tasked with making the catcher sprite animate when it caught the falling sprite. for my game, I made a baseball that falls, and when it is caught by the glove controlled by the player, the glove changes colors and rotates to simulate a glove catching a ball. for extra credit, I also added a score in the corner which goes up when you catch a ball and goes down when you miss a ball. I made this by making a variable called "num" and assigning it to a text command, then increased "num" when the glove detected touching the ball, or decreased "num" when it didn't.
